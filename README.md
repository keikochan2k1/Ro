# Ro

Ro is a experimental simple 2D engine written in SDL2 for learning purposes.
It's currently in initial state, and I'm really newbie at SDL2, so it may have bugs/errors/bad-written code. Any help will be apreciated! Also, there's no visible functioning yet, as I'm working first on it's structure of Engine, Scene, Resource Managing, et cetera.

## Why the name Ro?

I have never been very good at naming my programs. This is no exception.

## What are the advantages of using Ro?

I don't know. It's not anything wonderful, I'm making it to be a simple engine structure for facilitating game creation. I don't even know the route it's going to take. As I already said, any help will be apreciated!
