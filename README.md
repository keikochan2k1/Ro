# Ro
Ro is a experimental simple RPG engine written in SDL2 for learning purposes.
It's currently in initial state, and I'm really newbie at SDL2, so it may have bugs/errors/bad-written code. Any help will be apreciated! Also, there's no visible functioning yet, as I'm working first on it's structure of Engine, Scene, Resources, et cetera.
